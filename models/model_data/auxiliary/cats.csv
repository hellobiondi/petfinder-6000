one night late 2021, ming’s ex-owner put him in a carrier, took him out to a nearby carpark far enough from his home and cruelly dumped him near a bush.
ming was so frightened and confused but slowly crawled underneath the bush to hide.
he was shaking with fear that he couldn’t even stand up nor accept any food given to him.
in the night, when no one was around he crept into a nearby carpark where he hid there for 8 days before he was found.
by then he was so skinny and starved and gorged the food offered to him.
ming is around 3-4 years old, has been sterilised, deflea-ed.
he is meek and docile and like all cats, will snarl in defence if he doesn’t know you but he will neither scratch nor bite and once he warms up to you, he can even chat with you.
he loves his food and is a joy to feed.

one day, we found him with an open wound and brought him to the vet. during his hospitalisation, one of the vet techs fell in love with him, and he had a short 3-day home trial with her and her family. it was then that we realised how suitable timmy is in a home and how good he is with kids. he was purring and kneading instantly, and allowed the kids to carry him in any way without retaliating. however, timmy did not get along well with the two cats in the home and he was returned to us.
we had released him back to the streets as our original plan was to tnr him. however, just a week later, we found him with wounds again as he had fought with a free-roaming cat from another neighbourhood who had wandered to the carpark (please keep your cats fully indoors at all times). as the carpark is not safe for him, we are currently fostering timmy but we are not able to keep him permanently. while his wounds have fully healed, timmy is still looking for a furever home or a fosterer who is able to provide him with all the love and attention he desires.

hi adopters! this is friday, she was found abandoned in a laundry basket in yishun. a lady had brought her home with the intention to keep her but faced some obstacles. so i took over friday’s rehoming.
shy at first, friday warmed up to me and the fosterer very fast on the first night. she has since become more confident. unfortunately, because she couldn’t get along with the resident cat, so she has been isolated in the dry toilet and fosterer rotate their living room roaming schedule. tends to get irritated very fast.
 grey tuxedo with a heart shape black nose. she also has bright and alert eyes.
 about 1 year old, her energy level is medium to high, easily excited with plays and may get over simulate and then nip the humans.
 litter box trained. confident cat, but still slightly traumatized by ber abandonment. potential adopter will require to understand cat’s body language and be patient to train her.
 not very food motivated, slightly picky and has sensitive gi. currently on quality daily delight wet food, loveabowl kibbles and on pre/probiotics to manage her sensitive gi.
 spayed, dwormed and deflea twice, showered once.
 fiv/felv negative! ears do require some attention as she is now on treatment for her yeast infection in ears.
: suitable to be the only cat in the household.
if you wish to get her to join your cat/cats, i will require the document of the fiv/felv status of your existing cat/cats.
as a young cat, she will live for at least another 15 to 20 years. therefore potential adopters should have the financial means to provide for her good quality of wet and dry food, healthy environment and love her unconditionally.
she’s currently at fosterer, visit can be arranged, but based on his availability. location: sembawang.
your home visit can be arranged as well but subject to my availability. weekends preferred for viewing.
100% reimbursement of her vet fees. (receipts in post).
potential adopters will be screened according to cws guidelines, especially meshing of windows (no soft mosquito mesh, unsure i can guide you). there’ll be signing of cws contract, post adoption visit and i will require regular updates if possible.
if you are a student under 18, i will need your parents’ consent and screen the family together. everyone in the family will have to agree to take care of the cat.
will you give her a place in your loving home?

i have previously posted about him before. he is the comm cat that we took care of, and someone threw screws inside his food. so we are fearful that someone might harm him. but in this case, we might have to put him back to the community

-he is a total lap cat

requirements for adopter:
1. meshed/cat proofed
2. willing to discipline him when he is naughty

with a heavy heart . i have to put this two lovelies for adoption due to sudden pregnancy allergies to cats which has unable me to breath properly and also have severe rashes all over my bodies.
they are my lifeline when i had no one. they were the only ones that was there when i needed something to cope with my anxiety. they are my everything.
they are a great pair . i adopted them together as siblings and since then they have been together. they are not neutered and vaccinations were not taken as i had taken them in from another owner.
as their mother , it really breaks my heart to put them for adoption because they are smart , not a fussy eater , always crave for your attention ( especially adik ) and you will find them cuddling together all the time sleeping together
so please,
 if there is any interested parties . do contact me urgently . 80137662 .
no adoption fees needed . just a very good home so i would feel safe to let them go .

bindee was found in my condo bin centre. she had been there for 1 week and was cared for by the cleaners.

i found bindee to be very lethargic and brought her to the vet. we discovered more than 6 bite wounds on her. many were badly infected. she also had many claw marks all over her abdomen.
poor bindee, she was so badly attacked. she must have been in so much fear and pain.

i am hoping to find bindee a home as life as a stray clearly has been very harsh on her. i cannot bear to release her as she would only to get attacked by the same cat again.

bindee is a very friendly and gentle cat. she is suitable for a first time cat owner. she is also suitable for a home with children.

she loves belly rubs, back rubs and is a very affectionate cat. she can also be carried like a baby.
patient integration is necessary for a multi-cat household as she has been badly traumatised by another cat.

please dm me if you would like to give bindee a warm loving forever home. she may look ordinary but she has the biggest gentlest heart.

about handsome

handsome is finally ready for his forever home! he is a very chatty cat, he does not like to be confined in an enclosed space and prefers to roam around the house. he is extremely affectionate, loves to seek attention from human. he loves scratching boards. he is suitable for cat owner with some experience with handling cats. he may not be suitable for multi-cat household due to his dominant personality.

background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old.
coming to one year down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.
medical background:

• estimated. 3-4 years old

• fully vaccinated

• sterilised and microchipped

• dewormed and deflea

• basic vet check, felv-/fiv-
⁣adopters’ requirements:

• min. 21 years old⁣⁣

• gate and windows must be fully meshed

• vet care when necessary ⁣⁣

• quality food ⁣and playtime ⁣⁣(strictly no whiskas, friskies, or other supermarket brands)
their new pawrent should also provide lots of love, attention and quality playtime. playtime helps human to bond quickly with their cats. we can provide advice on meshing if you are unsure. they should be fed quality food and go for an annual vet check as a good practice.

i was a pet cat before but one day i was dumped out at the void deck. as i wasn’t neutered then, i always fought with the community cats at night, causing unhappiness amongst the residents and the caregivers of the community cats. after sterilisation, i was released back at the void deck but i continued picking up fights with the community cats, injuring some of them. this frustrated the caregivers further and one day i was scruffed and kept indoors. the next thing i heard was that the fosterer would try to rehabilitate me (yes, i was quite nasty to humans as well, but that’s because i am protecting myself in an unfamiliar environment) and then put me up for adoption.
there are a few cats living in where i am now. i was placed in a large cage so that the fosterer could monitor my behaviour and also for her to gain my trust. fast forward, i observed how friendly the other cats are and i also began to trust my fosterer. i allowed her to touch me, carry me and groom me. i love to be with other cats too but the fosterer said i am a giant boy and played too rough with other cats (who are senior cats and special needs’ cats) at times. hence, i can only be out of my cage for a few hours when my fosterer is around. i always look forward to these precious hours.
i would really love to be in a home where i can have wet food everyday (yummy) and for someone to play with me. i know how to use the litter box and i know how to use scratch posts. i like to climb on top shelves at times to look out of the window too so your windows must be catproofed! i tend to be a bit talkative but that’s my way of ‘chatting’ with you. i do not mind to live with another resident cat (if you have one) but i prefer my new friend to be the submissive type. you will also need to be patient and give us time to integrate.

mr brown is a community cat with felv (fiv negative) who is in looking for a forever home! he is approximately 6 years old, male, and sterilised. he is currently suffering from a gum infection, which the vet suspects to be stomatitis. as such, he would require to take daily anti-viral medication to manage it, if not it would be too painful for him to eat.
he is a very shy cat, but once he gets used to you, he is very affectionate and will want lots of rubs and pets. he needs some patience, as he startles easily and is quite timid. therefore, it is very important that windows are meshed and the house is a safe environment for him. i can help introduce him to you, hopefully that will speed up the process of him getting to know you! as such, adopters must be open to home visits.
an experienced cat owner is preferable as he potentially requires to be fed medication daily, and also because he has felv. i am willing to sponsor part of his usual vet fees and medicine fees, and i will be willing to sponsor all of his necessary vaccinations and deworming/flea/tick removal. i can provide litter box, cat bed, carrier & scratching post. he heavily prefers dry food and kibbles, he shows little interest in wet food and will only lick it a little. as he is a stray, he is also not yet litter trained.
right now with his gum infection, he can only eat kibbles that are very small in size. currently, i am feeding him acana pacifica kibbles. he is not a fussy cat, and once his gum infection recovers or is managed, he will be willing to eat most kibbles.

things to take note of about soda:

soda has been sterilised, vaccinated(one dose only, see next pointer for info), dewormed, deflead and tested negative for felv and fiv. clean and healthy!
he is not fully vaccinated as he had a limping symptom after his first shot (which recovered shortly), so the vet advised that if he is always indoors, there is no need to get the remaining vaccine. if he were to go to a multi-cat family, make sure the other cats are fully vaccinated and there will not be a problem.
he is very energetic, it is best if he can go to a family already with a cat or planning to have multi cats.
he was alone since a kitten so sometimes his play bites can be a little rough, that is why having a companion is good for him to learn to control. otherwise, pls be prepared to play with him at least twice a day to drain out his energy.
he loves humans! but doesn’t like to be cuddled or touched. typical cat behaviour  he will always be around you, lying on your feet or nearby with his belly showing (but no, don’t touch his belly even if it’s very tempting xd）
he has got a really sweet voice and likes communicating with short meows, also, he knows how to play fetch!
litter box, cat tree, food and water bowls and all his toys and items can be taken together with him once the adoption is confirmed, for free.

urgently looking for a forever home together
since mow & murry were rescued, they’ve moved from one foster home to another thrice and we feel really bad since they’re such trusting and human-loving furkids. the moving around was unsettling for them and we’re concerned that this may bring about feelings of dejection. so, we hope and pray that mow & murry can soon find a family to spend forever with.
here’s a little background story.
mow & murry were abandoned as kittens and after tnr, they continued to live on the streets till mow got into trouble in a prohibited construction site.
before complains escalate or anything life-threatening occurs, we decided to trap and introduce the indoors to him as street life is no longer ideal for mow. after which, his regular feeder requested for his sister to be reunited with mow as they’re very bonded and we agreed though re-homing a pair is more challenging but we knew it was the right thing to do.

today, the duo is estimated to coming 3 years young.
no known health issues
fiv & felv negative
they

few enquires but none came true for her.

mesha yearns for a home. from her recent ac with jess, mesha told us not to anyhow adopt her out. when ask what type of adopter you like, she said someone sincere and “like us”.
she told us that she felt sad and left out. she also misses interaction with other cats which is true. other than her early days as a kitten outdoor, she has been isolated. even though she can see them, she can’t really have full interaction. she told the ac that she felt sad and being left out.
other then what she has, she is overall a healthy and active cat who loves to play and seek attention.

she is suitable to in a single cat household or at most one other cat.

active, clever and laid-back, thomas is an outgoing cat that loves company and playtime. he loves to interact, but especially favours cardboard, feathers and things that roll around. when the cat teaser comes out, he can get pretty acrobatic too!

this smooth talker has an amazing range of different vocalisations: from motorcycle-engine purrs when he’s on your lap to little chirps that say ‘attention, please’. his curiosity and high-energy levels may make him more suitable for patient folks willing to put some effort into training him and setting boundaries, so he’s probably not for homes with young children. but give thomas a chance and he’s bound to give you a big affectionate welcome every time you come home.





he can be independent and also loves being a lap cat. good in an one cat household.



estimated to be 5 yrs old, sterilised, fiv/felv neg, de-wormed,deflead and vaccinated.

my background is quite messy. i was taken out of a restricted zone by a staff and brought home to avoid being culled by pest control. but i was left at a coffeeshop the next day because the family didn’t allow any cats at home. i was then brought home by someone else but i escaped. eventually i was spotted in a filthy condition, looking pitiful at a playground. i was finally brought into my current foster home and i am now ready to be rehomed.


during my fostering days, my health was in a “yoyo” state and at times, i had to be on medication. i hated that and foster momma had a tough time with me. this is partly why one of my eyes is cloudy as i wasn’t cooperative while i was being medicated for my infected eyes. my fosterer still tried to medicate, else my eye would have been worse. however, the cloudiness did not affect my overall eyesight.


there is a reason why my nickname is hooligan. i don’t like to share my food with other cats or i will smack them. i will also stalk and irritate other cats if i don’t like them. but i am happy to be with humans. i like to play with toys and i like humans to pet me but no cuddling please. i don’t mind being groomed but you have to be patient with me. i will also need 2 litter boxes because i’m a clean freak. if the litter boxes are dirty, i may do it on the floor


i have been longing for a home with my humans whom i can live with for the rest of my life. but i have to be the only cat in the home. i’m not that bad lah cos i did hear foster mummy and daddy say i’m actually very cute.

he’s only 1 year old and he have been living in the wild behind the hotel so it may take him a bit of time to fit into the new living environment. however, he’s highly motivated by play and i believe the way to connect/bond with him is through play time with lots of teasers and toys as well as his favourite chicken gravy wet food.
friday is best suited for a household without any cat because unfortunately, he’s a felv positive cat. but he’s extremely young and healthy and still have a long journey ahead of him. with quality food and immunity supplement, he is able to lead a normal life like any other cat and i wish to give him a chance to find his pawrent.
i will be providing 3 months worth of wet food as well as his nhv supplement plus new teaser toys & a new cat tree for him if you are a suitable fosterer / adopter. there is zero adoption fees involved. he’s on revolution and vaccinated. in addition, he has gone for a full check up at the vet and both vets diagnosed him as very healthy kitty estimated to be 1-2 years old.

i was a stray cat at wilby residences till one day my feeder noticed that i had a big nasty wound on my front paw. i was immediately rescued and brought to the vet where i was hospitalised for a month but thankfully i made a full recovery! though because of my wounds, i am tested fiv+. but that is ok – cos i am healthy boy!
a positive fiv test result should not be a death sentence. with proper care, cats with fiv can live many years and can usually
share a household with other, fiv-negative cats. i do live with 6 other fiv-negative cats at my foster home. but i
deserve my own home too!
i am a 5-6 years young black male, with white chest and white tummy (my hoomin fosterer always tease me that i’m wearing a white bikini), neutered and vaccinated. i am friendly, playful and good with other cats. i am very silly hence my ‘clown’ nickname, and will make you laugh with my antics. i absolutely love boxes! i love to bulldoze boxes with my head and just bite the heck out of it! i also love stick toys. i love my hoomin fosterer and i like keeping her company and sleep with her at night, on her bed. i sure would like a home with other cats so i am not lonely! please read here

chester’s feeder reached out for help to get him off the streets as he was old, and constantly getting bullied by the other community cats. chester had touched his feeder’s heart with his gentle demeanor and his displays of affection like crawling into his feeder’s lap for hugs. the feeder also felt really sad that chester had to live on the streets as he was once a home cat.
personality:
chester loves the company of people and would always bury his head in my arms or find opportunities to sit on my lap. he is still an independent cat that is not needy despite his keenest for affections from people. chester spends most of his time enjoying his cat naps. he is very calm in nature hence is is suitable to be around other cats, as well as children. (my own nephews who are in primary school adore him and he gets along with the other rescue cats at home.)
health:
chester is siamese flame point and approximately 14 years old. he does not have any big issues aside from ckd (chronic kidney disease). which means that his kidneys has lost some of the functions. the implications of which is that he drinks more water and pees more.
conclusion:
chester is a beautiful soul, i picked him up in the hope that he could spend his remaining years in the comfort of a loving home which he really deserves. he may not be the youngest and definitely comes with some health problems as well, but he is one of the gentlest cats i have come across.

 at 8 months young, they are a pair of cheeky and playful brothers who enjoy their toys and cozying up together.



pepper is sadly fiv positive but contrary to popular belief that fiv cats require costly vet fees and he does not need any medication and do not display any symptoms. many fiv cats go on to lead fulfilling and long lives similar to their non fiv counterparts. soba is extremely attached to pepper and hence they must be adopted together.



 homes must be cat proof with cat-proof window grilles as they love to explore high grounds.

 it could be from a street fight, something community cats are prone to.
bushy was looked after at the shelter after his wound was attended to at the clinic … since then, the shelter became his (temporary) home.
 we hope to find bushy a good and lovely home.
 he gets along well with other cats and will mind his own business.
 he will even wait for his turn to eat, while other cats all rush forward during feeding time.
bushy amazingly uses the sewage drainage hole to pee and poop … which means he doesnt need a litter box at home.
 he was given a litter box in his cage at the shelter but he preferred to use the tray instead.
a few criteria for adopters to note before considering an adoption:

cat- proof your home to ensure bushy is kept safe inside your home
feed an appropriate diet
be prepared to portion out vet fees as a pet may get sick and needs medical attention
allow for home visits before and after adoption – date/time will be pre-arranged to suit adopter’s timing

i am not asking for fees and my only concern is to ensure that the adopter is serious about caring for orange for the duration of her life (so serious enquirers only please). since she is a rescued cat, the move to a new home will be scary for her so the adopter must be patient and loving to allow for the bonds of trust to grow. prefer an adopter with some experience looking after cats.

found 5 kittens (3 are already adopted, left truffle & xiaomei only) at punggol end and realized they are not sterilized so i brought them in for sterilization & am now looking to rehome them! fyi i did ask around for mama cat but people said that they only saw these kittens appearing since the couple months ago with totally zero adult cat – potential abandonment maybe?


details:
– sterilized, microchipped, ear tipped under cws stray cat sterilization scheme
– all are local mixed!
– all are from the same litter & approximately 5-7 months now
– all are tofu/sand litter trained. so far none have peed/pooped anywhere out of the litter box!
– do note that they are legit wild animals so they take time to cool down & accept humans. please only adopt them if you have patience and don’t abandon them because they are not “friendly” to you!!
– you may ask me for more pictures/videos if you’re really keen in adopting them, or even come over my place to check them out!

about cara

cara is finally ready for her forever home! cara is slow to warm up to human but once she warms up she is very affectionate. she may be a little hard to manage for first-time cat owner, prefer adopter to have some experience with handling cats.

she has a cute heart shape at the side of her body which makes it easy to recognise her. she has definitely shown improvement in her interaction with human, however new adopter must be patient and give her time to get used to the new environment.

background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old.
coming to one year down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.
medical background:

• estimated. 2-3 year old

• fully vaccinated

• sterilised and microchipped

• dewormed and deflea

• basic vet check, felv-/fiv-
⁣adopters’ requirements:

• min. 21 years old⁣⁣

• gate and windows must be fully meshed (no gaps allowed e.g. half meshed gate will be rejected)

• vet care when necessary ⁣⁣and annual health check

• quality food ⁣and playtime ⁣⁣(strictly no whiskas, friskies, or other supermarket brands)
their new pawrent should also provide lots of love, attention and quality playtime. playtime helps human to bond quickly with their cats. we can provide advice on meshing if you are unsure. they should be fed quality food and go for an annual vet check as a good practice.
if you are keen to adopt cara of #thecabinetkitties, please message us to chat and find out more. basic screening is mandatory for all adopters, we will require you to fill up questionnaire and arrange a video call to meet the cat to ensure that it is a good fit.",False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,juvenile,chill,independent,sweet,3,no,neutral,neutral,neutral,working full time,owned,no preference,yes,2023-05-15T02:51:07.988Z,2023-05-15T02:51:07.988Z

kuro was basically left to roam the streets as his previous humans were busy with their baby. the family eventually decided to give him away. feeders in the area took him in to ensure that he is rehomed to a responsible family that will love and treasure him. he is such a loving cat that deserves a better life.

don’t be deceived by nikko’s size. i think nikko seeks human attention more than food. the first thing she does every morning is to rub against my legs and asks for pats before she starts eating. although she looks huge, she does not eat a lot. she is also quite playful. despite her size, she would leap high and run fast when she sees a target. nikko spends most of her time sleeping on her bed.
nikko has a unique fur colour, white and pale brown. she is a cat with attitude and does not like to be handled, so household with kids are not recommended. however, she enjoys head and chin rubs. once you gained her trust, she follows you everywhere. at the right time of the day, she even allows you to rub her belly. she is usually calm and does not make noise.
spayed and vaccinated. groomed a month ago. no health issues detected during last blood check in jan.

 sterilized
 no health problems
 no adoption fee

 very low maintenance (not needy, quiet)
 will provide a few months’ worth of cat food, litter, litter box, bowls
 will be able to live with other cats if they are calm and give her space





sweet pink nose, green eyes and a charming stubby tail. on the smaller side. has lived indoors almost all her life, used to be a street kitten.

do note that suki is not a very ‘affectionate’ cat – she generally likes to be left alone and will spend her time napping everywhere. she will approach you if she wants to be close to you, such as lying on your stomach.

reason for giving up for adoption:
she’s one of two cats that my sister abandoned the start of this year (2022).
the other cat, pixie (a few years younger) stresses her out as she plays rough and frequently disturbs her when she goes to the toilet/eats, to the point where suki has to go and hide halfway. pixie too was a street kitten but unfortunately the years they’ve been living together has not improved their relationship.
i am alright with keeping pixie and giving suki to a more peaceful home that’s suitable for her, where she can nap away and enjoy her more senior years.




requirements:
– must stay indoors
– meshed/grill windows in home or a dedicated room. will be happy to help you with this



– i will need to visit your home and you are free to come see suki in mine. no stress – just want to meet you in-person and ensure both suki and you will be a good fit for each other!

as is the case for many mother cats, bungus’s kittens have all been adopted but she is still waiting for a forever home to take her away from a hard life on the streets. while kittens are more popular and “adoptable”, more mature cats have just as much love to give. they’re also more independent and much easier to take care of.




bungus is calm, gentle, and affectionate. she likes to come up for head rubs and enjoys being stroked. she is quiet except for when she thinks it’s mealtime, which is when she will meow to let you know the same. she is well-behaved: we managed to pick her up and trim her nails upon our second meeting with her.

* extremely food-motivated (this is a good way to start getting to know her!)
* loves scritches around the head and neck area (it’s very cute when she’s enjoying it.)
* not very street-smart… she’s likely being bullied and getting into fights with other community cats. this stresses her out, which leads to over-grooming and some baldness.

requirements
* for her to go to a loving home and be a solely indoor cat. she should be the only cat or only pet in the household.

meet meowdonna the little explorer!
meowdonna is one of four rescued tabby kitties from a hoarder family. she is the first among her siblings to open up, and as such is ready for adoption.
meowdonna can be a little shy at first as she was confined in a cage her entire life. with time, however, she will open up. she’s a little explorer – roaming around the house and self-entertaining whenever you have no time for her. she is also starting to enjoy human interaction too. although she’s not a lap cat now, but she is affectionate in her own way by being near you.
as there have not been any human interaction before being fostered, meowdonna is slowly learning how to be a house cat. as such, adopter needs to be patient and be willing to invest time in her. with more play time and regular feeding, she will definitely blossom and be very affectionate eventually. she observes my cats’ behaviour a lot, and copies them. as such, she is suitable in a household where there are 1 – 2 other cats. single cat household is okay too, but adequate attention should be given to ensure she is happy.

 she was most probably abandoned as she was found roaming with a collar whilst heavily pregnant. she was small built, scrawny but a friendly kitty to passerbys.
 a kind lady and her family took her in for fostering for her to have a safe place to give birth.
 in oct 2019, lola gave birth to 7 kittens.
 lola nursed all 7 and kittens grew up strong and healthy.
 all kittens have been adopted except for lui & lucy who are still looking for their forever home together.
 they are on a separate adoption post.
once her kittens were weaned off, lola was sent for sterilisation. a few days post sterilisation, her fosterer noticed that her wound was infected.
 she was brought to the clinic and antibiotics was administered. her wound healed nicely but then she became constipated.
 she was brought to the clinic again and was given meds to cure her constipation.
 fast forward, lola is now healthy and quite a foodie.
 this would explain her “round” shape, a far cry from when she was first rescued.
 it is now time for her to find a forever home of her own.
 lola is independent, loves human company, can tolerate cats but would much prefer to be in a single cat home.
 if you can give her a home with lots of tlc, please wa me.

he’s had a tumultuous upbringing, but this little fighter pulled through with his baby-teeth gnashed and determined to play! now 9 months old, he is ready to find his forever home!



at 9 months old, he’s old enough to have grown out of the hyperactive, zoomy kitten stage but still young enough to be oh-so-playful!  you can tell from the pictures he has a bit of a naughty kid personality


and yet, everyday he will still cuddle up to you and sleep on you. he likes to sleep on his back on your lap or in your folded arms like a baby


growing up without siblings, he is very attached and will follow his owner around like a dog. look at the pics – in some of them he is waiting for his fosterer outside the toilet  he loves to playfully hug your leg.


aster is not easily phased. he has a gungho, curious and outgoing personality. he would do well with even young children. he can be a bit bitey though, so if you do have young children, you must be ready to train him out of this habit. he is very trainable and will respond if you train him. currently, he will sit, paw, and kiss on command  (of course, that’s only after you’ve formed a bond with him and trained him)


aster also loves to look out the window. aster is suitable for first-time cat owners, but he is not ok with dogs.


aster’s needs:
1. aster must be on a raw food diet. he is currently on raw duck. he will have diarrhoea for 1-2 days if he is fed other food like cat treats. however, he does really love his raw food so it can be used as treats as well. this diet costs about the same as a regular cat canned food diet.


2. aster used to have coronavirus. while he does not have it anymore, some cats can be shedders of the virus for life. unfortunately, there is no effective vaccine against coronavirus. hence, aster can only be with other cats that have had coronavirus and fought through it before and hence have the antibodies, or must be an only-cat. he is considered to be 100% healthy and this has no bearing on his health.

dobby and smoky are gentle and sweet boys. dobby has big soft paws; smoky has very soft fur. they are easy to handle and well-behaved. both are food-motivated and respond to treats, which will allow a new caregiver to quickly gain their trust.

both are very close to each other (sleep together, eat together, sometimes even use the toilet together!) so they must be adopted as a pair.

they can be suitable for a home with working adults as they are independent and they can be left alone, as well as suitable for families with children as they are very gentle.

i am not asking for fees and my only concern is to ensure that the adopter is serious about caring for the cats for their duration of their lives (so serious enquirers only please). since these are rescued cats, the move to a new home may be scary for them so the adopter must be patient and loving to allow for the bonds of trust to grow.

being very frightened, they did not know where to go, did not know how and where to find food and water. their madeshift ‘home’ was amongst the bicycles under a void deck and they were always hiding behind some folded cartons. they survived by rummaging nearby bins every night after midnight, gobling down on leftovers.
one day, a feeder spotted them when they were resting in a dark quiet corner and she started feeding them. such a harsh environment was never suitable for them and plans were made to trap both to be sterilised and rehomed. the trapping was fortunately a success. belle and her son were subsequently fostered while the feeder looked for suitable adopters for them.
belle became quite hostile and untouchable, even towards her son, ever since she was trapped and hence she had to undergo rehabilitation before being assessed fit to be rehomed. her son, on the other hand, being a kitten, was playful and adorable, unaffected by the trapping and was successfully rehomed.
fast forward, it has been almost 2 years and belle’s rehabilitation is progressing well! she has since integrated well with other cats. she learns how to integrate and interact by observing how the fosterer and the other resident cats behave towards one another. she has gradually learnt to trust humans again and now allows to be touched.
it is preferred that belle be adopted to a home with existing cat(s) that has mild temperament. reason being, belle is more comfortable having another cat with her as companion. it is also beneficial for belle to be able to follow and learn from the resident cat(s) which will make it easier for her to interact with the adopter.
the adopter also needs to be extremely patient with belle, to give her time and space to gradually warm up to you. she is not cuddly or a lapcat (but who knows she may be one in future) and when she warms up to you, she doesn’t mind sleeping next to you or be by your side when you are doing your personal stuff.
oh yes, belle is super treats-motivated (she only loves gold-d treats) and the adopter must be willing to continue with the treats every night. (hope it is not too much to ask for!) this nightly activity of feeding belle treats is also a good way of bonding with her.
after reading belle’s background, are you the one for her? are you willing to open up your heart and home to give belle a second chance? to have a home of her own so that she can shower you with all her sweetness and love?

tiger is no standard issue.



he is a gentle ball of fluff who will look into your eyes and walk between your legs. tiger enjoys some playtime chasing the elusive red dot or hunting his toy butterfly, but most of the day he’ll want to nap, if possible, next to you. he’s a chatty boy who will let you know when it’s time for breakfast and who’ll greet you at the door, unless he is napping.



tiger is ready for a forever home, in fact, he longs for one.



he’s 7-8 eight years old, fiv positive; felv negative, and has lost his teeth due to stomatitis. so he needs daily medication to make his life more comfortable. costs and current medication regime can be shared with interested adopters



but make no mistake, tiger has much warmth and silliness to offer, and will be able to enjoy a pampered and exclusively indoor life for years to come.

unfortunately… we have to let her go due to two reasons:

we have another older cat, and they love playing with each other. so much so that my other cat has now developed joint issues and we need to separate them. but living in a studio apartment, it is impossible to do so.
we have a newborn who needs us. while we are able to care for the two cats plus the newborn, living in a studio apartment is difficult. the midnight routine has given bella stress, and also caused her to be quite jealous as we we not able to give her the attention she’s used to.

we also call her the lucky cat because doesn’t she resemble the maneki-neko (招き猫, lit. ‘beckoning cat’) you see waving at you at the storefronts? it is a common japanese figurine which is often believed to bring good luck to the owner. bella has indeed brought us good luck the past 1.5 years with career and family growth. we hope her new family will receive good luck from bella too.
as a family companion, she’s sweet and loves attention. in other words, manja. she will snuggle up to your side (more so by your side than on your lap) while you’re watching television, napping, and even curls up at your feet while you’re seated on the toilet bowl. her mews are gentle but will grow loud when she’s hungry or craves more attention. she loves licking her tail and goes into a state of complete relaxation – you will see that she will be staring into space with her tongue still moving.
she is good with little children and is not afraid to play with them. she does sometimes get a bit too excited and chews on human fingers, but her small teeth doesn’t inflict pain. speaking of small, she’s smaller than an average cat – small head, lean body with long elegant limbs. when she curls up she’s about 20cm in length, though she stretches to about 80cm from front paw to hind paw.

their story

they were rescued from different places but placed together in a playroom at the foster place and eventually got along well. haiiro was found wandering in the forest alone by a dog feeder and alerted rescuer to come to the rescue. chairo was born in a factory where workers loved the cats. however, the factory may be shifting out and the cats will be out of food source, so the cats were removed from the area. chairo has 2 other siblings who will also be placed for adoption in pair.

about bentley

bentley is finally ready for his forever home! he’s such a handsome cat! he has a shy and timid personality, he often follow his siblings around. he does not socialize with human much. he is highly independent. if you are someone who likes cat that are independent and chill (not attention-seeking or too active), he will be suitable for you. you may need some experience with handling cats as he may struggle during grooming and not exactly easy to handle.

he’s also suitable for multiple cat household, they are accustomed to having many cats around them. if you are considering on adopting a buddy for your current cat, you may give bentley a chance.
background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old.
coming to one year down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.

freckles showed up at our block of flats in october 2021. she is friendly and initially seem naive of any dangers. she was noticed by many passerbys as she just hangs around looking for anyone with food for her. she seem to build a small group of fans, who will sayang her when they pass by. her fan club including children and adults.

flip side for her is there are bullies – 2 and 4 legged. eventually she hide in drains more and seem more nervous.

in feb 2022, i decided to catnap as i was getting more worried for her wellbeing. it’s also sad to see her with no place to shelter properly on rainy days.

she seem too young to live the rest of life as a comm cat.

freckles settled well in home environment. knows to use litter box right away and loves sofas and beds. she has not jumped on high places except for beds and sofas. she is independent and comes to me for back rubs or when she has done her toilet and comes to report

i don’t keep a cat so far but find her easy to have around. she does ask for back rubs and will sleep in bed with me at night.

there are many good years for her and i would like to find her a good family; able and willing to care for her till the end. home has to be cat proofed. no free roaming, please.

i prefer a family who has cats before. i am not sure how she will react to other cats but she has not been aggressive or domineering in anyway. she doesn’t like to be carried, hence need a confident adopter.

playful and free hana is looking for a new home. he’s very direct when he wants to play and hang out, and loves the freedom to roam the vicinity outside the residence. unfortunately, we’re unable to provide him with the freedom he desires as he tends to become sad and whiny when unable to run around freely. hana is affectionate once he gets to know you and loves to just be around you and hang out in the same space. hana is suitable for a cat owner who can provide a property that allows him to roam outside safely, or has enough time to engage with hana to curb his roaming tendencies.
background
hana was adopted by us when he was a kitten, found in a neighbor’s backyard as a stray. since then he’s been raised in a semi-indoor environment, our property is only on the second floor, and hana is accustomed to roaming the outdoors when it gets dark. hana doesn’t play well with other cats but is fine with humans (he just tends to be shy at first).
we hope to find a suitable home for hana where he can be happy and healthy living the lifestyle he prefers. if you’ve come across this and find that hana isn’t the right pet for you, please do share it with friends or family who would like to welcome a free-spirited individual to their home!

a fosterer will need to have a cat-proof home and be able to keep the kitty indoors all the time.
 it will be very helpful if you have experience fostering young/adult kitties.
 we will provide food and needed medical attention to the kitty while under foster care.

about silvia

silvia is finally ready for her forever home! silvia is a chill and affectionate cat. she is very gentle and easy to handle, perfect companion for adopter who loves a chill and independent cat who will also show some affection. she is also food motivated as she tend to steal food from other cat’s bowl. suitable for first time cat owner.
background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old.
coming to one year down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.
medical background:

• estimated. 2-3 years old

• fully vaccinated

• sterilised and microchipped

• dewormed and deflea

• basic vet check, felv-/fiv-
⁣adopters’ requirements:

• min. 21 years old⁣⁣

• gate and windows must be fully meshed (no gaps allowed e.g. half meshed gate will be rejected)

• vet care when necessary ⁣⁣and annual health check

• quality food ⁣and playtime ⁣⁣(strictly no whiskas, friskies, or other supermarket brands)
their new pawrent should also provide lots of love, attention and quality playtime. playtime helps human to bond quickly with their cats. we can provide advice on meshing if you are unsure. they should be fed quality food and go for an annual vet check as a good practice.

about erika

erika is ready for her forever home! erika is slow to warm up to human but once she warms up she can be affectionate. she loves her head rubs and butt scratch. she is suitable for cat owner with some experience. she is selective with cats that she’s okay with so may not necessarily work well in a multi-cat household.

background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old.
coming to one year down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.
medical background:

• estimated. 2-3 year old

• fully vaccinated

• sterilised and microchipped

• dewormed and deflea

• basic vet check, felv-/fiv-
⁣adopters’ requirements:

• min. 21 years old⁣⁣

• gate and windows must be fully meshed (no gaps allowed e.g. half meshed gate will be rejected)

• vet care when necessary ⁣⁣and annual health check

• quality food ⁣and playtime ⁣⁣(strictly no whiskas, friskies, or other supermarket brands)
their new pawrent should also provide lots of love, attention and quality playtime. playtime helps human to bond quickly with their cats. we can provide advice on meshing if you are unsure. they should be fed quality food and go for an annual vet check as a good practice.

july 2020
ella is a lucky girl! in january this year she was brought to the vet by her owners to be euthanised because they were leaving singapore. thankfully, the awesome doctor there didn’t agree with this decision and pleaded with the owners for some time for this girl to be rehomed.
so, here she is! sweet and affectionate. her purrs are so loud, you almost gotta put on ear plugs! and l believe it’s her way of saying thank you for letting her live. and we too are thankful that she is alive, happy and well.
ella, is 2 years old. spayed, vaccinated in january and is tested negative for fiv/felv. she doesn’t demand much, a little bit of playtime, some love, a small corner in your home, is all she ask for.
ella is a 100% strictly indoor cat and the home she goes to has to be cat proofed. cws regulation and strict adoption screening applies.
if you think you are able to give ella a forever home, drop me a message and tell me abit about yourself and why you would like to adopt her. thank you!

(a) do you have a safe and loving home for the cats? please adopt.
* fully meshed home that i don’t have to worry 0.0000001% that u tell me they fell off the flat/ disappear from the house. i will cancel my work to help u find the cat but you are jeopardising my potential funds to feed the rest.
* will give them ample food and will give full medical care should they fell ill/ grow old. i hope this is reasonable that i expect the cat to live better w you than w me? you definitely would have more time than me for the cat. but food and medical must be mandatory too.

about kendall

kendall is finally ready for her forever home! she takes some time to warm up to you. she is chill, and is independent. she can be alone or adopted with her siblings. if you like a cat that is chill and independent you may consider kendall. she loves her head rubs and will come to you when she feels like it.

background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old (as of 2020).
coming to 2+ years down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.
medical background:

• estimated. 3-4 years old

• fully vaccinated

• sterilised and microchipped

• dewormed and deflea

• basic vet check, felv-/fiv-
⁣adopters’ requirements:

• min. 21 years old⁣⁣

• gate and windows must be fully meshed (no gaps allowed e.g. half meshed gate will be rejected)

• vet care when necessary ⁣⁣and annual health check

• quality food ⁣and playtime ⁣⁣(strictly no whiskas, friskies, or other supermarket brands)
their new pawrent should also provide lots of love, attention and quality playtime. playtime helps human to bond quickly with their cats. we can provide advice on meshing if you are unsure. they should be fed quality food and go for an annual vet check as a good practice.
if you are keen to adopt kendall of #thecabinetkitties, please message us to chat and find out more. basic screening is mandatory for all adopters, we will require you to fill up questionnaire and arrange a video call to meet the cat to ensure that it is a good fit.",False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,adult,chill,independent,sweet,1,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,working full time,owned,no allergies,yes,2023-05-15T02:51:38.836Z,2023-05-15T02:51:38.836Z

white chest’s story is a typical one. he appeared one day at the powerhouse and became one of the regular comm cats whom the feeder gladly included in her feeding round. he was brought to neuter and returned to his site after a while. it has been a rainy week hence feeder decided to release only when the rain stops.
however, misfortune happened shortly. white chest met with an accident and escape. he did not appear at his usual spot and feeder looked for him. luckily he was found shortly after and rushed to the vet, he has a broken jaw from the impact. despite this, white cheat remains to be a happy go lucky and strong fella. he has a hearty appetite and simply lives for food
he has since recovered and feeder decided to seek a home for him.

​during our weekly feeding rounds, we discovered this canteen and were super excited to find a cat island on singapore, but at the same time really taken aback by the sheer number of cats found there and worried about the cats. besides the 10-15 cats in the cage, there are some 20-30 roaming cats at the back of the canteen, where there are many car workshops and factories. luckily, the roaming cats have been sterilised by the cat welfare society. we also helped to sterilise a few of the cats there and to rehome sweet cookie and sweet rome.
​as the industrial estate is currently undergoing redevelopment in stages, cat angel angela, who kindly goes down to the industrial estate without fail on a daily basis to feed all the cats there, is very concerned about the cats and hopes to rehome all of them. the factories and canteens might be gone in a year or two, and the cats will have nowhere to go  kitten sanctuary has kindly taken in five of her cats and kittens, but there are still many of them in need of homes. at the same time, new cats are being abandoned at the canteen faster than the existing cats are being rehomed. the cats live each day not knowing whether they would see the next. they fall prey to doggies and speeding lorries. to protect them from the doggies and lorries, angela keeps them in the cage at night. it is like a one-star hostel for the cats, with only the bare necessities available. compared to our cats at home sleeping on comfortable beds, playing with plenty of toys, climbing cat trees, drinking clean water and eating healthy food, the cats at the canteen live in an austere environment. it is really sad.
​please help the canteen cats! please help us to share this post and let us know if you or anyone you know would be able to take the cats in. thank mew so much *purrs and headbutts from the cuties*

at first glance, pepper seems like a cutie pie, small and handsome. when we tried to go near his cage to feed him and clean the cage, however, he lunged at the gate and growled loudly. there was no way we could feed him without getting scratched. we were really helpless and at a loss as to what to do. we desperately wanted to rehome pepper and his sister, millie, from the day that we set our eyes on them, but how do we do that without proper space and experience if they are so skittish? pepper and millie were just cute little fluffballs barely the size of a rat, running around the kitchen of a factory precariously with their mummy, with an eye on our food and the other eye constantly on the lookout for possible hazards like big looming hoomans, heavy vehicles, dogs and other threats. the poor little ones were forced to grow up faster than our sheltered pets. they must have been terrified as some of their friends had passed away right under their eye from dog attacks or lorry accidents.
about a month ago, we caught pepper and millie for sterilisation. that was when we discovered that pepper wasn’t the easiest cat to handle as he would hiss, growl, stamp his paws and charge at the carrier gate. millie was shy and she would hiss in fear too but she didn’t try to attack us. poor pepper must have been through a lot to be so reactive to humans.
after we sent pepper and millie to the clinic for sterilisation, the clinic staff informed us that pepper had a wound on his tail. we didn’t even notice it at first as it wasn’t obvious from the position that he was sitting in  poor pepper… that must have been the reason for his swiping and growling. he wasn’t an aggressive cat by nature, but he needed to protect himself and he was in pain from his wound. the clinic staff said pepper was fierce too and asked if we wanted to treat his tail wound or leave it. we told them to treat pepper’s tail wound. whether or not we were going to rehome pepper, we knew we had to treat him. we could not just leave him in pain and release him with a raw wound.
the doctor did an xray for pepper and found that he had a fractured tail. it was probably an old wound as there had been signs of healing. there was still blood on pepper’s wound though, so he required daily wound cleaning. as pepper did not allow us to go near him at that time, we had to board him at the clinic. after about a week, his wound seemed to be dryer, so we discharged pepper and continued to care for him at home. we decided to rehome pepper and millie after all. we just didn’t have the heart to release them.
initially, pepper was still very much a scaredy-cat, always hissing when we approached the cage and cowering in fear. he would also lunge at the gate before we could open it to place the food inside. we were so scared that we could only drop kibbles one at a time into the cage through the holes on top.
after about a week, pepper seemed to let his guard down slightly. with each passing week, we could see his improvement. he gradually started rubbing himself against the cage, although he still hisses at strangers. we thought that perhaps he was ready to explore life beyond his cage, so we let him out to smell the flowers and grass. it was certainly the right decision. pepper allowed us to carry him to and from the grass, and he was elated to be out. he soaked in the sunshine and pranced around joyfully. we were so happy just looking at him.
millie stayed in the cage when we opened the door, but she was also very happy when we carried her out to play with her brother. she is so cute. we just want to squish her when we see her. she is a really clever and sweet girl. we love her so much. she looks like totoro and is probably totoro’s younger sister from a later litter. she used to be fearful too but will now inch closer for a chin rub. how adorable
pepper and millie have come a long way and started to trust and love humans. will you give them a furever home, show them the kindness and beauty in this world and help to maintain their love and trust in humans please? thank you

currently they are living in a busy household and unfortunately, my family and i are unable to offer 100% of our attention to hannah and martin. we are in desperate need for a kind-hearted caretaker to love our furbabies.
both are male brothers, 7 years young, neutered, litter-trained, leash-trained and never been separated. never picky with food and will never shy away from chances of affection.
martin is the younger brother of the duo. he is sometimes nervous around new people, but once he gets comfortable, he is an endearing manja lap cat who enjoys snuggling his humans.
on the other hand, hannah is the older brother. unlike martin, he is the polar opposite; hannah is very sociable and loves forming new bonds and enjoy a good tummy rub and ear neck face massage. more easygoing, he is also affectionate and playful.
both brothers looovveeee boxes and chasing string on sticks with their humans.

background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old.
coming to 2+ years down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.

.

hi all!! my 2 favourite little boys are ready for adoption! you can follow their story on @sunshine.fruit on instagram. i’ve tagged all their stories in the highlights and made 2 reels about them. i found them at my workplace in a construction site office where they are part of an unsterilized cluster of cats. they are part of the group of cats i’ve brought out of the site office for rehoming based on their personality. they are really very good kitties. they are to be adopted together because they’re very much bonded and dash needs bagheera as his support system. they do everything together. please do not be apprehensive about adopting 2 cats at once. it’s actually better because they’ll entertain each other when you’re busy sometimes.
dash (ginger tabby kitten)

was skittish and afraid of humans when i met him at site. was reluctant to be near me but had to because he wanted food (no. 1 glutton) and bagheera loves human interaction. he has now grown to love humans he is familiar with, will watch tv with his foster family, affectionate, inquisitive and follows foster mummy everywhere she goes. he is also more active than bagheera.
bagheera (black kitten)

he acts as the big brother for dash. calm, patient, sweet, likes to be near humans. he loves scritches and head rubs, wags his tail when happy. he is also not afraid of strangers and is a confident little guy.
they may like to go outside. they can both be taken on walks after training and on secure harnesses with full supervision. as they’re both kittens, they’re naturally more hyper and need vertical space (and horizontal for zoomies) to climb and explore.

after more than a month of rehabilitation, shelly has bloomed to be an inquisitive sweet little kitten. however, she still requires a couple of minutes to warm up. once it is done, she is pretty affectionate and will sit next to the human. if you are looking for a kitten that is not too playful yet affectionate, with the potential to be a lapcat, she is the right one for you!

mimi is an extremely sweet cat! when we found her at an industrial workplace, she was well known to be the motivation and happiness there! she is very well loved due to her sweet demeanor. however, it was better to find her a better home as it was a construction area which could be dangerous for her and her kittens. she is also a super good mother at such a young age to her kittens and always watching over them.
toothless (male) and sesame (female) = bonded 3 months youngs siblings. vaccinated, fiv/felv negative

toothless was named after the dragon, in “how to train your dragon”! besides his looks, his character is similar too! he is cheeky, curious and in a way blurr. he loves to play and will go to you for attention! he looks super alike to his sister, sesame, but one way to differentiate them is by their face size (nose is bigger on toothless) and by the stripes on his forehead. he is definitely a fun kitten companion to any family.
sesame is a little shy kitten but she is braver when her brother, toothless or mummy, mimi is around. however, she loves a human to play with her and her brother! she just need time to get to know you. she has a smaller and more blurr face as compared to her brother. i would say she has more innocence in her and is able to melt my heart by giving in to her. definitely an angel kitten to have

about baby monster

baby monster is finally ready for his forever home! we often call him baby monster as he is extremely food driven and attention seeking (loves sayang and chin rubs). he also loves following you around closely. he is still a kitten, so he has endless burst of energy (extremely active and play-motivated).
 he’s not really a monster, it’s just a cute name we gave him because he loves to stick around a lot whenever we clean them up or want to feed them, he will always be first in line. if you love an attention seeking cat, you will love baby!! however, he takes time to warm up in a new environment and will only be closed with people he’s familiar with. he is food motivated so you may use food to build bond with him. we will guide you along if you’re patient to learn.


background story

he was found by a kind passerby, he and his other 3 siblings were young kittens being placed in a box, suspected to be abandoned. they were handed over to our rescuer to foster and put up for adoption. his other siblings have already found homes a few months back except for baby monster. we hope you will consider this really affectionate baby!

we are looking for an adopter for dear copper. he is a community cat who likes to roam around but he used to come home to a friendly & generous resident (his feeder) who welcomed him to their backyard and provided food, water, bed & warm cuddles for copper and 2 more cats. sometime in july 2022, copper was taken to the vet due to loss of appetite, unusual fur-shedding and infected toe. he was confined in the clinic until his infected toe was treated and recovered. he is currently being fostered by kind young couple where copper is getting better and is eating well.
copper is a very gentle cat and has a very calm demeanour. he is gentle even with kids. during his time at an adoption drive, families with young kids came and kids loved him! and he was very calm as the kids pet him.
his story was also mentioned on channel news asia who happened to be at the event. check copper’s story out in this link:
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pet-cat-hdb-microchip-avs-survey-welfare-framework-public-consultation-2919451
would you be so kind to give him the care & love he needs?
here’s our dear copper’s profile:

male
introvert, sweet, gentle & loyal
neutered & microchipped (to be transferred to adopter)
estimated age: 3 years & 9 months old (est. birthdate: 06/10/2018)
currently at 3.12 kg
fiv negative-
felv positive+ (tested negative already but will be tested again in a few months to confirm his immune has fought off the virus)

a screening process will be done to ensure copper’s wellbeing and finding a home that is most suitable for him. thank you so much for your gracious understanding.
for any questions or (better yet) commitment in giving copper a loving home (indoor), please contact preferably by whatsapp joanna at 98599532.

about mino

background story

in oct-nov 2020, we managed to rescue 61 cats out from a hoarder case (#thecabinetkitties) which was widely covered by the media. the cats lacked social interaction with human and not only that, all of them were in poor health condition. one of them unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer, while most of them had serious skin and fur problems. the oldest cat from the family is 4 years old while most of them are ranging 1-2 years old.
coming to one year down the road today, many of them have finally recovered from their skin and fur problem, and also successfully passed their rehabilitation. now we are posting up their profiles here, hoping to find them a loving home, they deserve a second chance after going through so much in their earlier years.
if you have chanced upon this page, we hope you will help us share their adoption post even if you are not planning to adopt at the moment and just browsing! every share will allow these cats to stand a chance to find their forever homes.

chix is slightly less vocal compared to mask (still very vocal when it’s feeding time), plays with any toys given to him and loves cuddling with his brother. beware that he can be protective of his food at times (though, it’s rare). he is very affectionate, will ask for pets and cuddles and warms up to people quite fast with food. very playful! he can sleep anywhere. eats his food quite fast and may try to eat mask’s food afterwards (he has improved a lot on that).
